zip.files[Filename].async('text')

looks through zip files and finds the one with the name 'Filename' then reads it as text while continuing the program

this way we are telling JSZIp to read the files 

loadasync() can be used to load the data from the file into JSZIp

when you use try ur basically saying try this unless it can throw an error

try {
    const jsonObject = JSON.parse(content);
}

catch {
    console.error("cannot load json", err)
}

if in the try there is an error the catch will catch it and display it on console
